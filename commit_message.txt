Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(clustering): Debug distance matrix computation issue

Investigating ValueError in distance matrix calculation. The reshape to (-1, 1) changed array dimensions. Running debugger to understand broadcast error. Testing with print statements to inspect array shapes. Found that A_reshaped[i] returns 1D array [value] not scalar value.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
