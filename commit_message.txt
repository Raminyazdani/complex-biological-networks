Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(control): Initialize network controllability analysis module

Created main3.py with network controllability structure. Defined network topology (vertices, edges with weights) and control input configurations. Built adjacency matrix construction and prepared framework for controllability matrix computation. Foundation for control theory implementation.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
