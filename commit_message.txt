Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | feat(control): Implement minimum driver node finder

Created main4.py for finding minimum driver node configurations. Implements combinatorial optimization to determine minimal control sets. Uses itertools.combinations to test all possible driver node subsets. Finds optimal control configurations for network controllability.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
