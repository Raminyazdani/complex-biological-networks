Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(deps): Add network analysis dependencies

Added networkx to requirements.txt for graph data structures and algorithms. Added sympy for symbolic mathematics in controllability analysis. Both dependencies critical for main2.py, main3.py, and test.py functionality.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
