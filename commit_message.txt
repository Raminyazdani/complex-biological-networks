Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(clustering): Add K-means clustering implementation

Implemented K-means clustering algorithm with 3 clusters in main.py. Added sample data array [1, 7, 10, 11, 14, 20] for testing. Set up structure for hierarchical clustering to be added next. This provides foundation for network pattern identification and grouping analysis.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
