Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(deps): Add visualization dependencies with typo

Added matplotlib and seaborn to requirements but **BUG:** typed 'matplotli>=3.4.0' instead of 'matplotlib>=3.4.0' (missing 'b'). Error caught when running pip install -r requirements.txt with version not found error.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
