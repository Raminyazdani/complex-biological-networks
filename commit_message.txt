Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(deps): Debug pip install failure

Ran pip install -r requirements.txt and got error "Could not find version that satisfies requirement matplotli>=3.4.0". Reviewed requirements.txt line by line. Found typo in matplotlib package name - missing 'b'. Need to correct package name.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
