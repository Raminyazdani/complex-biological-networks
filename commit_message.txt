Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | feat(docs): Fix run commands and paths in README

Corrected all run commands to execute from repository root (just 'python main.py'). Fixed path references. Verified instructions work by following README. Added better structure with What It Does, Tech Stack, and Repository Structure sections.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
