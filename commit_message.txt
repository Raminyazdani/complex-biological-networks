Implemented controllability matrix calculation: C = [B, AB, A²B, ..., Aⁿ⁻¹B]. Added matrix power computations using NumPy and rank calculation for controllability testing. Set up structure for exact controllability tests. Core control theory mathematics implemented.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
