Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | feat(clustering): Fix array indexing in distance matrix calculation

Fixed array indexing bug by correcting to distance_matrix[i][j] = np.sqrt((A[i][0] - A[j][0]) ** 2). Now properly accesses scalar value at index [0] after reshape. Tested and verified distance matrix computation works correctly. Common NumPy mistake when working with reshaping operations.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
