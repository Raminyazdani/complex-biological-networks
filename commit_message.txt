Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | feat(config): Update .gitignore for Python artifacts and temp files

Enhanced .gitignore to exclude __pycache__/, *.pyc, temp Word files (~$*.docx, ~WRL*.tmp), .ipynb_checkpoints/, *.egg-info/, dist/, build/. Prevents committing generated files and build artifacts.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
