Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(docs): Test README instructions and find errors

Following README setup and run instructions to verify accuracy. Attempted 'cd network-analysis && python main.py' but directory doesn't exist. Checked repository structure - files are in root, not subdirectory. Found additional path reference errors. README needs correction.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
