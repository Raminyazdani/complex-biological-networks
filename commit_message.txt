Created repository with README, LICENSE (MIT), requirements.txt with core dependencies (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, networkx, sympy, jupyter), and .gitignore for Python projects. Established foundation for network controllability and causal discovery analysis framework. Set up standard project structure following Python best practices.
