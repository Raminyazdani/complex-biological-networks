Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | feat(experimental): Add Jupyter notebook for symbolic analysis

Created test.ipynb for experimental symbolic controllability matrix analysis. Added echelon form computations and interactive testing environment. Provides workspace for exploring symbolic matrix properties and controllability theory interactively.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
