Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(control): Debug ModuleNotFoundError for colorama

Investigating import error. Ran python main3.py and got "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorma'". Checked import statement and found typo. Reviewed requirements.txt - colorama is listed correctly. Simple typo in import line: missing 'a' at end.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
