Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(control): Implement adjacency matrix construction

Added detailed adjacency matrix construction from edge list in main3.py. Implemented weight assignment to matrix elements. Set up validation of matrix properties (dimensions, symmetry checks for undirected graphs). Foundation ready for controllability matrix computation.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
