Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(clustering): Add hierarchical clustering and visualization imports

Added scipy hierarchical clustering imports (dendrogram, linkage) and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization. Set up framework for hierarchical clustering dendrograms and distance matrix heatmaps. Prepared visualization pipeline for clustering results.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
