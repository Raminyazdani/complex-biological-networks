Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(docs): Add initial README with command errors

Created comprehensive README with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples. **BUGS:** Incorrect run commands 'cd network-analysis && python main.py' (no such directory exists) and typo in data path reference. Documentation needs testing and correction.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
