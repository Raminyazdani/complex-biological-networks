Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(causal): Implement PC algorithm basics for causal discovery

Created main2.py with PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm structure. Added conditional independence testing using partial correlations and implemented edge removal logic based on independence tests. Added data generation (random_pc_data.csv) and NetworkX imports for graph operations.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
