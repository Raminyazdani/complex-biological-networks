Ramin Yazdani | Complex Biological Networks | main | WIP(control): Implement iterative controllability matrix building

Implemented loop for constructing controllability matrix C = [B, AB, A²B, ...]. Added matrix power computation with NumPy. Set up concatenation logic for building full controllability matrix. Testing rank calculation approach.

Verified working by running relevant scripts and checking outputs.
Tested on Python 3.12 with all dependencies installed.
